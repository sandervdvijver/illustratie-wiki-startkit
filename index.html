          <strong>Pickling</strong> is the process of

          >
          in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine">brine</a> or
          immersion in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar">vinegar</a>. The
          pickling procedure typically affects the food's texture and flavor.
          The resulting food is called a <em>pickle</em>, or, if named, the name
          is prefaced with the word "pickled". Foods that are pickled include
          vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, meats, fish, dairy and eggs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pickling solutions are typically highly acidic, with a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH">pH</a> of 4.6 or lower, and
          high in salt, preventing
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme">enzymes</a> from
          working and micro-organisms from multiplying. Pickling can preserve
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition">perishable</a>
          foods for months, or in some cases years.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"

          herbs and spices, such as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_seed">mustard seed</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic">garlic</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon">cinnamon</a> or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clove">cloves</a>, are often
          added. If the food contains sufficient moisture, a pickling brine may
          be produced simply by adding dry salt. For example,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a> and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea">Korean</a>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi">kimchi</a> are produced
          by salting the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable">vegetables</a> to
          draw out excess water. Natural fermentation at room temperature, by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_bacteria"
            >lactic acid bacteria</a
          >, produces the required acidity. Other pickles are made by placing
          vegetables in vinegar. Unlike the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning">canning</a> process,
          pickling (which includes fermentation) does not require that the food
          be completely
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"
            >sterile</a
          >. The acidity or salinity of the solution, the temperature of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation">fermentation</a>,
          and the exclusion of oxygen determine which microorganisms dominate,
          and determine the flavor of the end product.
        </p>

        <p>
          When both salt concentration and temperature are low,
          <em
            ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuconostoc_mesenteroides"
              >Leuconostoc mesenteroides</a
            ></em
          >
          dominates, producing a mix of acids, alcohol, and aroma compounds. At
          higher temperatures

          dominates, which produces primarily
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid">lactic acid</a>.
          Many pickles start with <em>Leuconostoc</em>, and change to
          <em>Lactobacillus</em> with higher acidity.

          <p>
            Pickling with vinegar likely originated in ancient
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>
            around 2400 BCE. There is archaeological evidence of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber">cucumbers</a> being
            pickled in the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigris_Valley"
              >Tigris Valley</a
            >
            in 2030 BCE. Pickling vegetables in vinegar continued developing in
            the Middle East region before spreading to the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb">Maghreb</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily">Sicily</a>, and

            it spread to the

            Fermented salt pickling reportedly originated in China.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is sufficient archaeological evidence that pickling was also
            practiced in

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a> was
            known to credit the pickles in her diet for her good health and
            beauty. Roman emperors were also known to make pickles a part of
            their troops' diets, with the belief it would make them stronger and
            more fit for battle.

            Pickling was used as a way to preserve food for out-of-season use
            and for long journeys, especially by sea.

            invented to preserve foods, pickles are also made and eaten because
            people enjoy the resulting flavors. Pickling may also improve the
            nutritional value of food by introducing

              Indian gooseberry (amla), and chilli. Vegetables such as eggplant,
              carrots, cauliflower, tomato, bitter gourd, green tamarind,
              ginger, garlic, onion, and citron are also occasionally used.
              These fruits and vegetables are mixed with ingredients such as
              salt, spices, and vegetable oils. The pickling process is
              completed by placing filled jars in the sun where they mature in
              the sun. The sun's heat destroys moulds and microbes which could
              spoil the pickles.

              and easiest being <em>Shio-zuke</em> which translates to
              <em>salt pickles</em>. This method tends to be the most widely
              used, and a version of this method called
              <em>ichiyazuke</em> (overnight pickle) which as the name indiates
              is a sped-up pickling process (using salt) that can be completed
              overnight and ready to serve the next day.

              verb meaning "to dry" because after the Umeboshi is pickled, it
              dries out in sunlight for 3-5 days (although some recipes
              recommend putting the fruit back into brine at night, to prevent
              molding).

              corn, onions, garlic, certain squashes and melons, and a few
              fruits such as plums and apples are used to make pickles too.
              Stuffed pickles are specialties, usually made of peppers or melons
              pickled after being stuffed with a cabbage filling. Pickled plum
              stuffed with garlic is a unique Hungarian type of pickle just like
              <em>csalamádé</em> and leavened cucumber
              <em>(kovászos uborka)</em>. <em>Csalamádé</em> is a type of

              made of cabbage, cucumber, paprika, onion, carrot, tomatoes, and
              bay leaf mixed up with vinegar as the fermenting agent. Leavened
              cucumber, unlike other types of pickled cucumbers that are around
              all year long, is rather a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silly_season">seasonal</a>
              pickle produced in the summer. Cucumbers, spices, herbs, and
              slices of bread are put in a glass jar with salt water and kept in
              direct sunlight for a few days. The yeast from the bread, along
              with other pickling agents and spices fermented under the hot sun,
              give the cucumbers a unique flavor, texture, and slight
              carbonation. Its juice can be used instead of carbonated water to
              make a special type of
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spritzer">spritzer</a>
              <em>('Újházy fröccs')</em>. It is common for Hungarian households
              to produce their own pickles. Different regions or towns have
              their special recipes unique to them. Among them all, the Vecsési
              sauerkraut <em>(Vecsési savanyú káposzta)</em> is the most famous.

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <p>
          In traditional pickling, fruit or vegetables are submerged in brine
          (20–40 grams/L of salt (3.2–6.4 oz/imp gal or 2.7–5.3 oz/US gal)), or
          shredded and salted as in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a>
          preparation, and held underwater by flat stones layered on top.
          Alternatively, a lid with an airtrap or a tight lid may be used if the
          lid is able to release pressure which may result from
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"
            >carbon dioxide</a
          >
          buildup. Mold or (white) kahm
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast#Nutrition_and_growth"
            >yeast</a
          >
          may form on the surface; kahm yeast is mostly harmless but can impart
          an off taste and may be removed without affecting the pickling
          process.
        </p>

        <p>
          In chemical pickling, the fruits or vegetables to be pickled are
          placed in a sterilized jar along with brine, vinegar, or both, as well
          as spices, and are then allowed to mature until the desired taste is
          obtained.
        </p>

        <p>
          The food can be pre-soaked in brine before transferring to vinegar.
          This reduces the water content of the food, which would otherwise
          dilute the vinegar. This method is particularly useful for fruit and
          vegetables with a high natural water content.
        </p>

        <p>
          In commercial pickling, a preservative such as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_benzoate"
            >sodium benzoate</a
          >
          or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDTA">EDTA</a> may also be
          added to enhance shelf life. In fermentation pickling, the food itself
          produces the preservation agent, typically by a process involving

              >Lactobacillus</a
            ></em
          >
          bacteria that produce lactic acid as the preservative agent.

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alum">Alum</a>, short for
          aluminum sulfate, is used in pickling to promote crisp texture and is

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"

          associated with Asian pickled vegetable consumption. Results from the
          research are described as having "high heterogeneity" and the study
          said that further well-designed prospective studies were warranted.
          However, their results stated "The majority of subgroup analyses
          showed a statistically significant association between consuming
          pickled vegetables and Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma".

              Fungi are of interest both for spoilage prevention and reduction
              of mycotoxins. Some pickle cultures are said to contain bacteria
              producing natural

              responsible for the creation of N-nitroso compounds, are reduced
              by low pH and/or high temperature. Inclusion of a

              (or the whole mushroom) also reduces nitrite content.

            While some pickled vegetables have potential health risks, certain
            pickled foods such as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive">olives</a> retain
            beneficial nutrients. Pickled olives contain monounsaturated fats,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant">antioxidants</a

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium">sodium</a> content
            can be high due to the brining process.
