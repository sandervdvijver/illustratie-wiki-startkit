          <strong>Straight edge</strong> (sometimes abbreviated as
          <strong>sXe</strong> or signified by <strong>XXX</strong> or simply
          <strong>X</strong>) is a subculture of

            >Straight Edge</a

          The straight-edge subculture emerged amid the early-1980s hardcore
          punk scene. Since then, a wide variety of various beliefs and ideas
          have been associated with the movement, including vegetarianism and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights">animal rights</a
          >. While the commonly expressed aspects of the straight edge
          subculture have been abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, and illegal
          drugs, there have been considerable variations. Disagreements often
          arise as to the primary reasons for living straight edge. Straight
          edge politics vary, from explicitly revolutionary to conservative.
          Some activists have approached Straight Edge with skepticism, ridicule
          or even outright hostility in part due to what they perceived as the
          straight edge movement's self-righteous militancy.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote that Straight Edge had gone through
          three eras since its founding in the early 1980s.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_edge">Bent edge</a> began
          as a counter-movement to straight edge by members of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C._hardcore"
            >Washington, D.C., hardcore</a
          >
          scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the
          scene. During the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_crew">youth crew</a> era,
          which started in the mid-1980s, the influence of music on the straight
          edge scene was at an all-time high. By the early 1990s, militant
          straight edge was a well-known part of the wider punk scene. In the
          early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States to
          Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South America.
          By the beginning of the 2000s, militant straight-edge punks had
          largely left the broader straight-edge culture and movement.

            <h3>1970s and early 1980s</h3>
            <p>
              Straight edge grew out of
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk"
                >hardcore punk</a
              >
              in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was partly characterized by
              shouted rather than sung vocals. Straight-edge individuals of this
              early era often associated with the original punk ideals such as
              individualism, disdain for work and school, and
              live-for-the-moment attitudes. The movement was influenced by the
              political and social climate of its origin, around the time of the
              "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Say_No"
                >Just Say No</a
              >" campaign and a rise in
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States"
                >conservative</a
              >
              viewpoints. The discipline of the subculture came from a mix of
              leftist
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics"
                >radicalism</a
              >
              and conservative influences.
            </p>

            <p>
              Straight edge sentiments can be found in songs by the early 1980s
              band
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Threat"
                >Minor Threat</a
              >. This anti-inebriation movement had been developing in punk
              before Minor Threat, but their song "Straight Edge" was
              influential in giving the scene a name, and something of a
              (somewhat unwilling) figurehead. Minor Threat frontman
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_MacKaye"
                >Ian MacKaye</a
              >
              is often credited with birthing the straight edge name and
              movement and in later years has often spoken out about how he
              never intended it to be a movement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Straight edge sentiments can also be found in the song "Keep it
              Clean" by English punk band
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vibrators"
                >The Vibrators</a

                >Modern Lovers</a
              >
              song "I'm Straight", recorded in 1973, which rejected drug use.

              Straight edge started in Washington, D.C., and quickly spread
              throughout the United States and Canada. By the 1980s, bands on
              the
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States"
                >West Coast</a
              >, such as America's Hardcore, Stalag 13, Justice League, and
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Choice"
                >Uniform Choice</a
              >, were gaining popularity. In the early stages of this
              subculture's history, concerts often consisted of both punk bands
              and straight edge bands. Circumstances soon changed, and the early
              1980s eventually was viewed as the time "before the two scenes
              separated". Other early straight edge bands include

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_edge">Bent edge</a>
                originated as a counter-movement to straight edge among members
                of the hardcore scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and
                intolerance of the scene. This idea spread; on Minor Threat's
                first tour in 1982, people identified themselves as bent,
                crooked, or curved edge. The counter-movement was short-lived,
                and it faded away by the end of the 1990s.

            <h3>Youth crew (mid-1980s)</h3>

            <p>
              During the youth crew era, which started in the mid-1980s, the
              influence of music on the straight-edge scene seemed to be at an
              all-time high. The branches of straight edge that came about
              during this era seemed to originate from ideas presented in songs,
              and many youth crew bands had a strong
              <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music"
                >heavy metal</a

              In the mid-1980s, the band Youth of Today became associated with
              the straight-edge movement, and their song "Youth Crew" expressed
              a desire to unite the scene into a movement. Vegetarianism became
              an important theme in straight edge during this era, starting with
              Youth of Today's 1988 song "No More", which contained lyrics
              condemning the consumption of meat. This trend toward animal
              rights and veganism within the straight edge movement reached its
              peak in the 1990s.

            <h3>1990s</h3>
            <p>
              By the early 1990s, straight edge became a well-known part of the
              wider punk and DIY scene and underwent musical and political
              shifts. In the early part of the decade, several straight-edge
              punks and their bands picked up on the vegetarian and other social
              justice politics of the mid-1980s and began comprehensively
              advocating for social justice,
              <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights"
                >animal liberation</a
              >, veganism, and straight edge. During this period, the straight
              edge scene birthed two major offshoots: the more conservative
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardline_(subculture)"
                >hardline</a
              >
              and the

                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_Krishna_in_popular_culture#Straight_Edge_subculture"
                >Krishna Consciousness</a
              >
              influenced, retrospectively known as
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnacore">Krishnacore</a
              >. While the majority of straight edge punks and
              <a

                >Hare Krishna</a
              >
              converts were pacifists, those influenced by hardline showed a
              willingness to resort to violence to promote their subculture.
              Musically, the straight edge scene increasingly was drawing from
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music"
                >heavy metal</a

            <h3>2000s</h3>
            <p>
              By the beginning of the 2000s, only small groups of militant
              straight edge individuals remained. Contrary to news reports that
              portrayed straight edge as a gang, several studies have shown that
              straight edge individuals as a whole are mostly peaceful people.
              In the 2000s, there was a growing amount of tolerance of people
              who do not follow the straight edge lifestyle by straight edge
              individuals. In this incarnation of straight edge, the musical
              styles of the bands involved are more varied, ranging from a youth
              crew revival style to metalcore to

        <h2>Ideology</h2>
        <p>
          Its philosophy in the early stages of straight edge was to rebel
          through self-control. With the ability to control one's actions, a
          straight edge participant would be better suited to stand against the
          mainstream. The first wave of straight edge did not impose rules on
          others, and participants chose to follow the ways of self-control.
          With the second wave of straight edge, these rules were used to
          control others. Additionally, the second wave experienced a change in
          music style. Where the first wave was influenced by hardcore punk, the
          second wave brought in aspects of heavy metal music that pushed for
          power and control over others. The slowing down of the music reflected
          the focus of individuals in their journey to self-control.

            Hate Edge (also known as NS or National Socialist Straight Edge) is
            a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazi">neo-Nazi</a>

            Sober and Angry Youth; both groups are responsible for attacks on,

          In the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States
          to Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South
          America. It grew around the world due to the relentless touring of
          youth crew bands and the ease of ordering records from American record
          labels via mail.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluff_Fest">Fluff Fest</a>,
          which has been held in the Czech Republic since 2000 and draws
          audiences from across Europe, is linked to straight edge through its
          organizers and showcases prominent straight edge bands.

          scene during the 1990s. Bands within the scene took heavily from heavy
          metal, and followed straight edge and vegan lifestyles. Some bands
          helped to pioneer the development of metalcore and then later on

            According to NoEcho writer Ethan Stewart "the closest thing to a
            straight edge band for much of the [1980s] was Statement", a
            solo-project by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apostles_(band)"
              >the Apostles</a

            drummer Patrick "Rat" Poole. However, despite Poole being drug-free,
            vegan and having a massive influence on the development of

              >hardline</a
            >, he did not identify with the straight edge label at the time.
            Additionally, many groups from the UK punk and hardcore scene did
            include straight edge members, namely
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napalm_Death">Napalm Death</a

          <p>
            The first entirely straight edge band in the country was
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steadfast_(band)"
              >Steadfast</a
            >, who formed in Durham in 1988. Despite originally being formed as
            a vehicle to annoy the members of the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho_punk"
              >anarcho punk</a
            >
            scene, the band eventually grew into a serious band. Following this,
            a number of additional straight edge bands began to form, including
            XdisciplineX, False Face, Headstong, Step One and Kickback. Nicolas
            Royles, drummer for
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_Throat_(grindcore_band)"
              >Sore Throat</a
            >, formed In Touch and Withstand around this time, which both
            morphed into No Way Out by 1990. This scene mostly was based in
            North East of England and Yorkshire and made up of musicians who
            became involved in the hardcore scene through
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding"
              >skateboarding</a
            >
            and the popularity of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal">thrash metal</a
            >. The bands were predominantly influenced by U.S. youth crew acts
            like Youth of Today and Gorilla Biscuits. Members of the existing
            punk and hardcore scenes in the country often reacted negatively to
            the straight edge bands, and on multiple occasions, fights occurred
            between the musicians and fans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of the first wave of UK straight edge bands had broken up by
            1991. However, a second wave began in the following years. Mostly
            based around Subjugation and Sure Hand Records, this wave saw
            members of many of the first wave bands form new bands and begin to
            embrace influences from heavy metal. The main location for this
            scene was
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_1_in_12_Club"
              >the 1 in 12 Club</a
            >, an anarchist club in Bradford, West Yorkshire, as groups like
            Unborn, Slavearc, Vengeance of Gaia and Withdrawn performed there
            frequently.
          </p>

          <p>
            A UK straight edge scene featuring entirely new musicians developed
            in the 2010s as a part of the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_of_British_Hardcore"
              >New Wave of British Hardcore</a
            >. Mostly based around Leeds, the scene produced groups like

              >Violent Reaction</a
            >,

            >, Insist, Unjust, Rapture, Regiment, True Vision and Shrapnel. A
            number of musicians from other UK hardcore bands were straight edge
            at this time, including Jimmy and Alex Wizard from
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Power_(band)"

      <section id="x-symbol">
        <h2>X symbol</h2>

        <p>
          The letter X is the most known symbol of straight edge. It is
          sometimes worn as a marking on the back of both hands, although it can
          be displayed on other body parts as well. Some followers of straight
          edge put the symbol on clothing and pins, and many bands aligned with
          the culture incorporate it into their names. According to a series of
          interviews by journalist Michael Azerrad, the straight edge X can be
          traced to the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Idles">Teen Idles</a>'
          brief West Coast tour in 1980. The band's members were scheduled to
          play at San Francisco's
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuhay_Gardens"
            >Mabuhay Gardens</a
          >, but when they arrived, club management discovered that they were
          all under the legal drinking age and would be denied entry to the
          club. As a compromise, management marked each of the members' hands
          with a large black X as a warning to the club's staff not to serve
          alcohol to the band.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon returning to Washington, D.C., the band suggested this same
          system to local clubs as a means to allow teenagers in to see musical
          performances without being served alcohol. The Teen Idles released a
          record in 1980 called
          <em
            ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Disturbance"
              >Minor Disturbance</a
            ></em
          >
          with the cover shot being two hands with black Xs on the back. The
          mark soon became associated with the straight edge lifestyle. It can
          also be used by drinking establishments to note a patron as under the
          drinking age, regardless of their views towards drugs such as alcohol.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later bands used the X symbol on album covers and other paraphernalia
          in a variety of ways. The cover of <em>No Apologies</em> by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_(band)">Judge</a> shows
          two crossed gavels in the X formation. Other objects that have been
          used include shovels, baseball bats, and hockey sticks. A variation
          involving a trio of Xs is often used in flyers and tattoos. It can
          also be ironic, based on the fact that three Xs was popularized in
          cartoons and television shows to signify alcohol or poison.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonshine">Moonshiners</a> used
          an X to note how many times a particular batch of moonshine ran
          through the still, adding irony. The term is sometimes abbreviated by
          including an X with the abbreviation of the term "straight edge" to
          give "sXe". By analogy, hardcore punk is sometimes abbreviated to
          "hXc".

        <h2>Approaches</h2>

        <p>
          While some straight edge groups are treated as a "gang" by law
          enforcement officials, a 2006 study found the vast majority of people
          who identify as straight edge are nonviolent. While the early hardcore
          punk scene in Washington, D.C., often is praised for its commitment to
          positive social change, both the youth crew movement of the 1980s and
          the vegan movement of the 1990s have drawn criticism. Straight edge
          has been approached with skepticism and hostility despite the less
          dogmatic and multifaceted character of contemporary straight edge.

      <section id="veganism" style="background-color: #f6ff00bb">
        <h2>Veganism</h2>
        <p>
          By the late 1990s, many straight edge participants gave veganism the
          same degree of importance as abstinence from intoxicants, and some
          groups styled themselves as "<strong>vegan straight edge</strong>",
          sometimes abbreviated "<strong>xVx</strong>". Bands such as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Crisis">Earth Crisis</a>
          and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegan_Reich">Vegan Reich</a>
          emphasized animal rights and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism"
            >environmentalism</a
          >
          as social justice issues. Perhaps owing to the "DIY" ethic of the punk
          subculture, some advocated
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action">direct action</a
          >, and became associated with the radical groups
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front"
            >Animal Liberation Front</a
          >
          and the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Liberation_Front"
            >Earth Liberation Front</a
          >. The US band Vegan Reich is most associated with the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardline_(subculture)"
            >"Hardline" subculture</a
          >, which espouses the

            >sanctity of life</a
          >, and draws connections between animal rights and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements"
            >anti-abortion activism</a
          >. Members of the Hardline movement have been described as espousing
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament">Old Testament</a
          >-style spirituality, militancy, and violence. Violent activism has
          been described as an "extreme minority" within the vegan straight edge
          movement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Haenfler writes that straight edge participants see veganism as an
          extension of the movement's emphasis on positivity, much like its
          preference to reserve sex for emotionally meaningful relationships.
          They tend to focus more on personal responsibility and focus less on
          confronting systemic issues in society. However, veganism is not seen
          as a matter of personal purity; it is rooted in a strong belief in
          animal rights and rejection of the exploitation of animals. Some hold
          that veganism is "true straight edge", and their promotion of veganism
          and animal liberation has been described as evangelistic.
